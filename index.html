<h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano staking </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: CP0, CP1 </p>
   <p> Stake pool CP0 is to stake my own funds but you can join and take advantage of the zero percent fee rate. It should produce acceptable returns compared to pools that charge higher fees until the pool becomes saturated with stake. I don't plan on creating more than one zero percent pool.</p>
   <p> Stake pool CP1 is to support the Cardano network and pay the costs of running the pools long term.  </p>
   <p> Will I create more pools? As the Cardano ecosystem grows I plan to grow with it but not any faster. I don't see the need for more than two pools at the moment. </p>

<h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano Staking </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: CP0, CP1 </p>
   <p> CrimsonPool currently operates two stake pools with ticker symbols CP0 and CP1. We're currently a small operation and have been part of the Cardano community since early 2018. We participated in the ITN and gained valuable experience there. Our narrow aim is to maximize return on stake for stakeholders like you. If we do our job you'll earn an acceptable return on your stake. Our macro aim is to contribute towards building a global web of unbroken trust through Cardano. We're supporters of decentralizing finance as we believe it will create a more inclusive, equitable and secure future for everyone. We currently operate five bare metal servers, each with 6-core cpus, in Hetzner's Finland data center running as relay and block producing nodes. We currently connect to peers using the cardano community guild-operators topology updater to select optimum peers to get our blocks out to the network quickly. Although this will eventually be replaced with IOG's peer to peer technology when it's ready and available to the stake pool operator community. Stake pool CP1 is currently underperforming pool CP0 in return on stake and we believe this is due to the stake level being too low. We're now monitoring the number of blocks that we're scheduled to produce and will compare that to what actually ends up on the blockchain to know for sure if low stake is actually the cause of the problem or if we are not getting all the blocks we produce on the chain. Please join us on this journey by staking with our pools. If you have a large amount of ADA please stake with pool CP1 to help get this pool running as well as CP0.  </p>
   <p> Stake pool CP0 is scheduled to make 4 blocks in epoch 250 (3 of 4 towards end of epoch) and 5 blocks in epoch 251. Stake pool CP1 is scheduled to make no blocks in epoch 250 and 4 blocks in epoch 251. Come back to see how we did. </p>
   <p> The name CrimsonPool comes from our aspiration to be associated with the crimson planet, Mars. Hopefully we'll be operating a Cardano stake pool there someday. Until that day comes we aspire to create a few apocalypse proof stake pools by operating solar powered servers far from big population centers and connecting them together using SpaceX's Starlink satellite network that should provide the lowest latency global interconnections between Cardano nodes. If you stake with us the money we earn will help achieve these aspirations. </p>

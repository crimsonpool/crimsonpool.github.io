<h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano Staking </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: CP0, CP1 </p>
   <p> Our narrow aim is to maximize return on stake for stakeholders. Our strategy is have reliable, performing operations and to keep maximum stake far from the saturation point by (1) keeping a relatively low profile and (2) communicating to existing and prospective stakeholders about the adverse effects of too much stake on returns. We're also willing to accept lumpy returns as long as the long term average return on stake is higher than a good benchmark, which we still need to identify. We'll also speak candidly to our stakeholders about our results, good and bad. My experience on the Incentivized Testnet showed that most stakepool operators are seeking to maximize their own rewards and not those of stakeholders. Our focus is on stakeholder returns and I have a personal interest in this since all of my own stake is these two pools. I'm eating my own cooking.</p>
   <p> Stake pool CP0 is to stake my own funds although you can join and take advantage of the zero percent fee rate. It should produce acceptable returns compared to pools that charge higher fees until the pool becomes saturated with stake. I don't plan to create more than one zero percent pool.</p>
   <p> Stake pool CP1 is to support the Cardano network and help pay the costs of running the two pools long term.  </p>
   <p> Will I create more pools? As the Cardano ecosystem grows I plan to grow with it but not any faster. I don't see the need nor the benefit to offer more than two pools at the moment. I think it's important to the long term strength and value of Cardano to have diversity in stake pool operators. </p>
   <p> The big picture aim of these two pools is to contribute in a small way towards building an unbroken web of trust in the world through Cardano. I hope you join us on this journey.  </p>

  <h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for decentralized Cardano Staking on Mars, someday </p> </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: RED, RED1 </p>
   <p> CrimsonPool currently operates two stake pools with ticker symbols RED and RED1. If you're staking less than 3 million ADA then stake with RED. We're currently a 1.1 person operation and hope to grow as more people stake with us. Our narrow aim is to maximize return on stake for stakeholders like you. If we do our job you'll earn an acceptable return on your stake while you're with us. Our macro aim is to contribute towards building a global web of unbroken trust through Cardano. We're supporters of decentralizing finance as we believe it will create a more inclusive, equitable and secure future for everyone. We operate five bare metal machines, each with 6-core cpus, in Hetzner's Finland data center running as relay and block producing nodes. We connect to peers using the cardano community guild-operators topology updater to select optimum peers to get our blocks out to the network quickly. Although this will eventually be replaced with IOG's peer to peer technology when it's ready and available to the stake pool operator community. </p>
   <p> The name CrimsonPool comes from our aspiration to be associated with the crimson planet, Mars. Hopefully we'll be operating a Cardano stake pool there someday. That may take a while! Until that day comes we aspire to create a few apocalypse resistant stake pools by operating solar powered servers far from big population centers and connecting them together using SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, which should provide the lowest latency global interconnections between Cardano nodes. If you stake with us the money we earn will help achieve these aspirations. </p>
   <p> I imagine the Cardano network on Mars will be separate from the one on Earth but linked with a store and forward system to enable transactions and smart contract interoperability between planets, even with the speed of light limitations of 5 to 20 minute latency each way. The network will initially be local to the first settlement via wireless and wired connections between people but will eventually utilize a SpaceX Starlink equivalent satellite system, Marslink?. Even before the first settlers reach Mars there will need to be a monetary exchange system en-route so I don't think it's too early to contemplate and plan for Cardano Mars.</p> 
   <p> If you stake with us you'll be helping to decentralize Cardano, which makes it more attack resistant.  </p>

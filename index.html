  <p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano Staking </p>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Ticker: RED </p>

  <p> Our narrow aim is to maximize return on stake for stakeholders. </p>
  
   <p> Our broader aim is to develop Cardano technology infrastructure on Mars for colony needs. Hopefully someday we'll be operating a stake pool there and will have helped establish a blockchain based governance system and local crypto currencies based on Cardano native token technology such as $HOSKY and $ADA. </p>
  
  <p> I imagine the Cardano network on Mars will be separate from the one on Earth but linked with a store and forward system to enable transactions and smart contract interoperability between planets, even with the speed of light limitations of 5 to 20 minute latency each way. The network will initially be local to the first settlement via wireless and wired connections between people but will eventually utilize a SpaceX Starlink equivalent satellite system, Marslink?. Even before the first settlers reach Mars there will need to be a monetary exchange system en-route so I don't think it's too early to contemplate and plan for Cardano Mars.</p>

  <h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano on Mars </p> </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Ticker: RED </p>
   <p> CrimsonPool operates one stake pool with ticker symbol RED. Our narrow aim is to maximize return on stake for stakeholders like you. If we do our job you'll earn an acceptable return on your stake while you're with us. </p>
   <p> Our broader aim is to develop Cardano technology infrastructure on Mars for colony needs. Hopefully someday we'll be operating a stake pool there and will have helped establish a blockchain based governance system and local crypto currencies based on Cardano native token technology such as $HOSKY and $ADA. </p>
   <p> I imagine the Cardano network on Mars will be separate from the one on Earth but linked together to enable transactions and smart contract interoperability between planets. The network initially will be local to the first settlement via wireless and wired connections between people but will eventually utilize an orbital satellite system. Even before the first settlers reach Mars there will need to be a monetary exchange system en-route so I don't think it's too early to contemplate and plan for Cardano Mars.</p>

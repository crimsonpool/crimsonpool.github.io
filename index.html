<h1><p style="text-align:center">CrimsonPool for Cardano Staking </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: CP0, CP1 </p>
   <p> Please upgrade to the latest Daedalus when it comes out today ( 3/Aug ) since a bug in the current version (2.0.0) prevents CP0 pool from being listed after I increased the pledge to 100k ADA.</p>
   <p> Stake pool CP0 is to stake my own funds although you can join and take advantage of the zero percent fee rate. It should produce acceptable returns compared to pools that charge higher fees until the pool becomes saturated with stake. I don't plan to create more than one zero percent pool.</p>
   <p> Stake pool CP1 is to support the Cardano network and help pay the costs of running the pools long term.  </p>
   <p> Will I create more pools? As the Cardano ecosystem grows I plan to grow with it but not any faster. I don't see the need nor the benefit to offer more than two pools at the moment. I think it's important to the long term strength and value of Cardano to have diversity in stake pool operators. </p>
   <p> The big picture aim of these two pools is to contribute in a small way towards building an unbroken web of trust in the world through Cardano. I hope you join us on this journey.  </p>
